Bootstrap Integration:

    Navbar: Used the navbar component to create a responsive, collapsible navigation menu.
    Buttons: Utilized Bootstrap’s button styles (btn btn-primary, btn btn-light, btn-outline-primary) for interactive elements like the scroll-to-top button and call-to-action buttons.
    Grid System: Applied the container and row classes for structured layout with two columns in the main content section.
    Utilities: Used Bootstrap’s utility classes like text-center, ms-auto, img-fluid, and d-flex for quick styling of text alignment, image responsiveness, and layout flexibility.

JavaScript:

    Scroll-to-Top Button: Implemented functionality to display the scroll-to-top button when the user scrolls down the page. The button is hidden when at the top and appears when scrolling down, allowing users to quickly return to the top of the page.

Interactivity:

    The scroll-to-top button is made visible by JavaScript as the user scrolls down, and hidden again when at the top of the page.
    Clicking the button scrolls the page smoothly to the top.
