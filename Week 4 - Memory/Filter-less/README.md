# Problem to Solve
Perhaps the simplest way to represent an image is with a grid of pixels (i.e., dots), each of which can be of a different color. For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, as in the below.

In this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)

A 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.

If the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, `0xff`, `0x00`, and `0x00` in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as `0xff` (otherwise known as `255` in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while `0x00` and `0x00` imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.

In a file called `helpers.c` in a folder called `filter-less`, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.


# Background
## A Bit(map) More Technical
Recall that a file is just a sequence of bits, arranged in some fashion. A 24-bit BMP file, then, is essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel’s color. But a BMP file also contains some “metadata,” information like an image’s height and width. That metadata is stored at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as “headers,” not to be confused with C’s header files. (Incidentally, these headers have evolved over time. This problem uses the latest version of Microsoft’s BMP format, 4.0, which debuted with Windows 95.)

The first of these headers, called `BITMAPFILEHEADER`, is 14 bytes long. (Recall that 1 byte equals 8 bits.) The second of these headers, called `BITMAPINFOHEADER`, is 40 bytes long. Immediately following these headers is the actual bitmap: an array of bytes, triples of which represent a pixel’s color. However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for green, followed by 8 bits for red. (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image’s top row at the end of the BMP file. But we’ve stored this problem set’s BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap’s top row first and bottom row last.) In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where `0000ff` signifies red and `ffffff` signifies white; we’ve highlighted in red all instances of `0000ff`.

Because we’ve presented these bits from left to right, top to bottom, in 8 columns, you can actually see the red smiley if you take a step back.

To be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. Accordingly, `ffffff` in hexadecimal actually signifies `111111111111111111111111` in binary.

Notice that you could represent a bitmap as a 2-dimensional array of pixels: where the image is an array of rows, each row is an array of pixels. Indeed, that’s how we’ve chosen to represent bitmap images in this problem.

## Image Filtering
What does it even mean to filter an image? You can think of filtering an image as taking the pixels of some original image, and modifying each pixel in such a way that a particular effect is apparent in the resulting image.


# Understanding
Let’s now take a look at some of the files provided to you as distribution code to get an understanding for what’s inside of them.

## bmp.h
Open up `bmp.h` (as by double-clicking on it in the file browser) and have a look.

You'll see definitions of the headers we've mentioned (`BITMAPINFOHEADER` and `BITMAPFILEHEADER`). In addition, that file defines `BYTE`, `DWORD`, `LONG`, and `WORD`, data types normally found in the world of Windows programming. Notice how they're just aliases for primitives with which you are (hopefully) already familiar. It appears that `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` make use of these types.

Perhaps most importantly for you, this file also defines a `struct` called `RGBTRIPLE` that, quite simply, "encapsulates" three bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on disk).

Why are these `struct`s useful? Well, recall that a file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk. But those bytes are generally ordered in such a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on. "File formats" exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what. Now, we could just read a file from disk into RAM as one big array of bytes. And we could just remember that the byte at `array[i]` represents one thing, while the byte at `array[j]` represents another. But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily? That's precisely what the structs in `bmp.h` allow us to do. Rather than think of some file as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of `struct`s.

## filter.c
Now, let's open up `filter.c`. This file has been written already for you, but there are a couple important points worth noting here.

First, notice the definition of `filters` on line 10. That string tells the program what the allowable command-line arguments to the program are: `b`, `g`, `r`, and `s`. Each of them specifies a different filter that we might apply to our images: blur, grayscale, reflection, and sepia.

The next several lines open up an image file, make sure it's indeed a BMP file, and read all of the pixel information into a 2D array called `image`.

Scroll down to the `switch` statement that begins on line 101. Notice that, depending on what `filter` we've chosen, a different function is called: if the user chooses filter `b`, the program calls the `blur` function; if `g`, then `grayscale` is called; if `r`, then `reflect` is called; and if `s`, then `sepia` is called. Notice, too, that each of these functions take as arguments the height of the image, the width of the image, and the 2D array of pixels.

These are the functions you'll (soon!) implement. As you might imagine, the goal is for each of these functions to edit the 2D array of pixels in such a way that the desired filter is applied to the image.

The remaining lines of the program take the resulting `image` and write them out to a new image file.

## helpers.h
Next, take a look at `helpers.h`. This file is quite short, and just provides the function prototypes for the functions you saw earlier.

Here, take note of the fact that each function takes a 2D array called `image` as an argument, where `image` is an array of `height` many rows, and each row is itself another array of `width` many `RGBTRIPLE`s. So if `image` represents the whole picture, then `image[0]` represents the first row, and `image[0][0]` represents the pixel in the upper-left corner of the image.

## helpers.c
Now, open up `helpers.c`. Here's where the implementation of the functions declared in `helpers.h` belong. But note that, right now, the implementations are missing! This part is up to you.

## Makefile
Finally, let's look at `Makefile`. This file specifies what should happen when we run a terminal command like `make filter`. Whereas programs you may have written before were confined to just one file, `filter` seems to use multiple files: `filter.c` and `helpers.c`. So we'll need to tell `make` how to compile this file.

Try compiling `filter` for yourself by going to your terminal and running

```
$ make filter

```

Then, you can run the program by running:

```
$ ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp

```

which takes the image at `images/yard.bmp`, and generates a new image called `out.bmp` after running the pixels through the `grayscale` function. `grayscale` doesn't do anything just yet, though, so the output image should look the same as the original yard.


# Specification
Implement the functions in `helpers.c` such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images.

-   The function `grayscale` should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
-   The function `sepia` should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.
-   The `reflect` function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
-   Finally, the `blur` function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.

You should not modify any of the function signatures, nor should you modify any other files other than `helpers.c`.
