# Problem to Solve
In a file called `hello.py` in a folder called `sentimental-hello`, implement a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/). Except that your program this time should be written in Python!


# How to Test
While `check50` is available for this problem, you're encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `David` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, David`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Inno` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Inno`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Kamryn` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Kamryn`.
