# Problem to Solve
Create a web application to keep track of friends’ birthdays.


# Understanding
In `app.py`, you'll find the start of a Flask web application. The application has one route (`/`) that accepts both `POST` requests (after the `if`) and `GET` requests (after the `else`). Currently, when the `/` route is requested via `GET`, the `index.html` template is rendered. When the `/` route is requested via `POST`, the user is redirected back to `/` via `GET`.

`birthdays.db` is a SQLite database with one table, `birthdays`, that has four columns: `id`, `name`, `month`, and `day`. There are a few rows already in this table, though ultimately your web application will support the ability to insert rows into this table!

In the `static` directory is a `styles.css` file containing the CSS code for this web application. No need to edit this file, though you're welcome to if you'd like!

In the `templates` directory is an `index.html` file that will be rendered when the user views your web application.


# Implementation Details
Complete the implementation of a web application to let users store and keep track of birthdays.

-   When the `/` route is requested via `GET`, your web application should display, in a table, all of the people in your database along with their birthdays.
    -   First, in `app.py`, add logic in your `GET` request handling to query the `birthdays.db` database for all birthdays. Pass all of that data to your `index.html` template.
    -   Then, in `index.html`, add logic to render each birthday as a row in the table. Each row should have two columns: one column for the person's name and another column for the person's birthday.
-   When the `/` route is requested via `POST`, your web application should add a new birthday to your database and then re-render the index page.
    -   First, in `index.html`, add an HTML form. The form should let users type in a name, a birthday month, and a birthday day. Be sure the form submits to `/` (its "action") with a method of `post`.
    -   Then, in `app.py`, add logic in your `POST` request handling to `INSERT` a new row into the `birthdays` table based on the data supplied by the user.

Optionally, you may also:

-   Add the ability to delete and/or edit birthday entries.
-   Add any additional features of your choosing!


# Testing
No `check50` for this problem set! But be sure to test your web application by adding some birthdays and ensuring that the data appears in your table as expected.

Run `flask run` in your terminal while in your `birthdays` directory to start a web server that serves your Flask application.
